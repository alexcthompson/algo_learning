These are all worked coding challenges from sites like HackerRank and LeetCode.  Or, in some cases, questions I was asked in interviews that I wanted to refine my answer, or maybe I blew it and wanted to figure it out.

I will try to leave a comment in each file with a link to the original problem.

I believe in writing tests, so even in the interview cases, I usually go back and write some tests.  At the very least, having some examples encoded as tests provides a great way to know if your code is working.
